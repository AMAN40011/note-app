📌 Why I Built This Project

As a developer, writing ideas, tasks, and quick notes is something I do daily. I noticed that many note apps are either too complex or require login / internet dependency.

So I built this Note App to:

Practice core JavaScript concepts
Understand DOM manipulation deeply
Build a real-world utility app without frameworks
Learn how to deploy projects using GitHub Pages
This project demonstrates how powerful vanilla JavaScript can be when fundamentals are strong.


🚀 Features
✍️ Create and save notes instantly
🗑️ Delete notes easily
💾 Notes persist using Local Storage
⚡ Fast & lightweight (No frameworks)
📱 Responsive UI for desktop & mobile
🌐 Works completely offline
🛠️ Tech Stack Used


HTML5 – Structure

CSS3 – Styling & layout

JavaScript (ES6) – Logic & functionality

GitHub Pages – Deployment


🧠 How It Works (Technical Overview)
Notes are created using JavaScript DOM manipulation
Each note is stored in browser localStorage
On page reload, notes are fetched and rendered dynamically
No backend → ensures fast performance and simplicity
This architecture helped me understand state management without libraries.
